# List of Created Components

This page is the documentation for the custom components created for this project. Each component has a description of its purpose, a list of its props (if there's any), and a how-to-use section.
**If new components are created, they should be added to this list in alphabetical order.**

## Icons

This component contains a limited list of svg icons that are manually copied and pasted from online sources. The icons are stored in the `icons` folder and its code are imported into the `index.js` file and exported as a single component. The icons are used in the `Icon` component.

### How to Use

```mdx
import { Icon } from 'components/icons'

<Icon.box /> Download .zip
```

### How to Add New Icons

1. Find and download an svg icon online. Make sure it's free to use and similar to the other icons in the list.
2. Place the svg icon in the `icons` component folder.
3. Open the svg file and copy its code.
4. Add a new property inside `Icons` with the name of the icon, and set its value to an anonymous function that returns the svg code as a JSX element (paste it inside the parentheses).

**Example:**

```tsx
export const Icons = {
  ...
  box: () => (
    <svg
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      fill="none"
      viewBox="0 0 24 24"
      stroke-width="1.5"
      stroke="currentColor"
    >
      <path
        stroke-linecap="round"
        stroke-linejoin="round"
        d="M21 7.5l-9-5.25L3 7.5m18 ..."
      />
    </svg>
  ),
  ...
}
```
