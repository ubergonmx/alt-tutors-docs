## General Description for each Layer

- **Site Map**: This layer refers to the general flowchart of all of the scenarios within the ALT Tutors website that would require a design sketchup.
- **User Flow**: This layer refers to the realted scenarios a user/student/teacher will face when joining and using the website. Currently it shows three basic flowchart:
  Authentication Flow, Tutor Finder Flow, and Tutor Setup Flow.
- **Wireframe**: This layer serves as the subfolder for the initial design and final design of the UI/UX. This is where majority of the design work is found and is also where comments
  will be expected for continuous edits and modifications towards the design.
- **Inspiration Board**: This layers saves all of the existing work found in different websites for inspiration.
- **Design System**: This layer is where the standard theme of the website is held. All of the exisitng components, logos, shapes, colors, typography is held together within this layer.
