# Technology Stack Primer

In this primer, we'll be reviewing the technologies we'll be using throughout the project.
Additionally, some fundamentals of JavaScript/TypeScript will be reviewed and some guidelines on naming vairables and functions.

## The Technologies

The project uses the following technologies:

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)** - A superset of JavaScript that allows us to write strongly typed code
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)** - A React framework that allows us to build server-side rendered React applications
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - A utility-first CSS framework that allows us to build responsive, mobile-first web applications
- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-prisma)** - A object-relational mapping (ORM) tool that allows us to interact with our database using TypeScript
