# Technology Stack Primer

This is an introductory guide to the technologies used in the ALT Tutors project.
We'll be reviewing common JavaScript/TypeScript concepts, the tech stack, and guidelines on naming vairables and functions.

## The Technologies

The project uses the following technologies:

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)** - A superset of JavaScript that allows us to write strongly typed code
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)** - A React framework that allows us to build server-side rendered React applications
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - A utility-first CSS framework that allows us to build responsive, mobile-first web applications
  - **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)** - A collection of re-usable Tailwind components
- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-prisma)** - A object-relational mapping (ORM) tool that allows us to interact with our database using TypeScript
- **[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction)** - An authentication library that allows us to easily implement authentication in our application
