# JavaScript / TypeScript Basics

This article cover some of the most common JavaScript and TypeScript basic concepts that you'll encounter and might be using for the project.

## JavaScript

### JSX / TSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write <ins>HTML-like</ins> code (e.g., `<div>{:html}`, `<p>{:html}`, etc.) in your JavaScript files, the same goes for TSX in TypeScript. It's used in React to define the structure and appearance of components.

```jsx filename="App.jsx"
import React from 'react'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="text-gray-100">
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <p>This is a React app.</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Notice that the `className{:jsx}` attribute is used instead of `class{:html}` to define the CSS class of an element. This is because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.

---

### Arrow Function (ES6)

Arrow functions are a shorthand way of writing functions in JavaScript.

```javascript /=>/ {2}
// Arrow Function:
const add = (a, b) => a + b
// is equivalent to Anonymous Function:
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b
}
// also equivalent to Named Function:
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

console.log(add(1, 2)) // Output: 3
```

Arrow functions are especially useful when you want to pass a function as a prop to a React component in short syntax.

```jsx /=>/
const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
}

const App = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked')
  }

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>
}
```

They are also useful for [map](#map), [filter](#filter), and [reduce](#reduce) methods.

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement in JavaScript. The format is `condition ? value1 : value2{:js}`.

It takes three operands: a `condition`, `value1` to return if the condition is **true**, and `value2` to return if the condition is **false**.

```javascript {3}
const age = 18

const isAdult = age >= 18 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
// is equivalent to:
let isAdult
if (age >= 18) {
  isAdult = 'Yes'
} else {
  isAdult = 'No'
}

console.log(isAdult) // Output: 'Yes'
```

A good example of using the ternary operator is when you want to render a different component based on a condition.

```javascript
const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768

const Layout = () => {
  return <div>{isMobile ? <MobileLayout /> : <DesktopLayout />}</div>
}
```

### Optional Chaining Operator

Optional chaining is a way to access properties on an object without worrying about whether they exist or not. It uses the `?.` operator to check if a property exists before trying to access it.

```javascript /?./ {10}
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    state: 'NY',
  },
}

const zipCode = person.address?.zipCode
console.log(zipCode) // Output: undefined
```

<Callout>
  Optional chaining is a safer way to access properties or methods that may be null or undefined,
  and it is *generally preferred* over the [non-null assertion
  operator](#non-null-assertion-operator).
</Callout>

### Map

The `map()` method is used to iterate over an array and return a new array with modified items. It's commonly used in React to render a list of items.

```javascript /map/ {3}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2) // uses Arrow Function
// also equivalent to:
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (num) {
  return num * 2
}) // uses Anonymous Function
// also equivalent to:
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(double) // uses Named Function
function double(num) {
  return num * 2
}

console.log(doubledNumbers) // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

A good example of using the `map()` method is when you want to render a list of items in React.

```jsx /map/
const items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'iPhone', price: 1000 },
  { id: 2, name: 'iPad', price: 500 },
  { id: 3, name: 'MacBook', price: 2000 },
]

const ItemList = () => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>
          {item.name} - ${item.price}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

The syntax is `array.map(function(currentValue, index?, arr?), thisValue?){:js}`.
The `function` takes three arguments: `currentValue` (the current item in the array), `index` (the index of the current item; optional), and `arr` (the array being iterated over; optional).

### Filter

The `filter()` method is used to iterate over an array and return a new array with items that pass a certain condition. It's commonly used in React to filter a list of items.

```javascript /filter/ {3}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0) // uses Arrow Function
// also equivalent to:
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function (num) {
  return num % 2 === 0
}) // uses Anonymous Function
// also equivalent to:
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(isEven) // uses Named Function
function isEven(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0
}

console.log(evenNumbers) // Output: [2, 4]
```

The syntax is `array.filter(function(currentValue, index?, arr?), thisValue?){:js}`.
The `function` takes three arguments: `currentValue` (the current item in the array), `index` (the index of the current item), and `arr` (the array being iterated over).

A good example of using the `filter()` method is when you want to filter a list of items in React.

```jsx /items.filter/
const items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'iPhone', price: 1000 },
  { id: 2, name: 'iPad', price: 500 },
  { id: 3, name: 'MacBook', price: 2000 },
]

const ItemList = () => {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('')

  const filteredItems = items.filter((item) =>
    item.name.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase())
  )

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={search} onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)} />
      <ul>
        {filteredItems.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.name} - ${item.price}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Reduce

The `reduce()` method is used to iterate over an array and return a single value. It's commonly used in React to calculate a total value from a list of items.

```javascript /reduce/ {3}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0) // uses Arrow Function
// also equivalent to:
const sum = numbers.reduce(function (acc, num) {
  return acc + num
}, 0) // uses Anonymous Function
// also equivalent to:
const sum = numbers.reduce(add, 0) // uses Named Function
function add(acc, num) {
  return acc + num
}

console.log(sum) // Output: 15
```

The syntax is `array.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue, index?, arr?), initialValue?){:js}`.
The `function` takes four arguments: `accumulator` (the accumulated value), `currentValue` (the current item in the array), `index` (the index of the current item), and `arr` (the array being iterated over).

A good example of using the `reduce()` method is when you want to calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart.

```javascript
const cart = [
  { name: 'iPhone', price: 1000 },
  { name: 'iPad', price: 500 },
  { name: 'MacBook', price: 2000 },
]

const totalPrice = cart.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price, 0)
console.log(totalPrice) // Output: 3500
```

It can also be used to group items by a certain property.

```javascript
const cart = [
  { name: 'iPhone', price: 1000 },
  { name: 'iPad', price: 500 },
  { name: 'MacBook', price: 2000 },
]

const groupedItems = cart.reduce(
  (acc, item) => {
    const key = item.price > 1000 ? 'expensive' : 'cheap'
    acc[key].push(item)
    return acc
  },
  { expensive: [], cheap: [] }
)

console.log(groupedItems)
// Output:
// {
//   expensive: [
//     { name: 'iPhone', price: 1000 },
//     { name: 'MacBook', price: 2000 },
//   ],
//   cheap: [{ name: 'iPad', price: 500 }],
// }
```

### Destructuring

#### Array

Array destructuring is a way to extract values from an array and assign them to variables in a single line of code. You simply use square brackets `[]` to define the variables and assign them to the array.

```javascript {3}
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const [asd, sample, c] = arr
// is equivalent to:
const asd = arr[0]
const sample = arr[1]

console.log(asd) // Output: 1
console.log(sample) // Output: 2
console.log(c) // Output: 3
```

<Callout info="info">
  Take note that the order of the variables matters. The first variable will be assigned the first
  value in the array, the second variable will be assigned the second value, and so on.
</Callout>

An example of using array destructuring is when you want to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.

```javascript
let a = 1
let b = ((2)[(a, b)] = [b, a])
```

We can also see this case with the `useState{:js}` hook in React. The `useState{:js}` hook returns an array with two items:

1. the `state value`
2. a `function` to update the state value.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

setCount(1)
console.log(count) // Output: 1
```

#### Object

Object destructuring is similar to array destructuring, but it's order-independent. You also use curly braces `{}` to define the variables and assign them to the object.

```javascript {10,11,12,13,14}
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    state: 'NY',
  },
}

const {
  age,
  name,
  address: { city },
} = person
// is equivalent to:
const age = person.age
const name = person.name
const city = person.address.city

console.log(name) // Output: 'John'
console.log(age) // Output: 30
console.log(city) // Output: 'New York'
```

### Spread Operator

The spread operator `...` is used to spread elements of an array or object into another array or object. It's commonly used to concatenate arrays or merge objects.

```javascript {4}
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6]

const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2]
console.log(combined) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

A real world example of using the spread operator is when you want to add a new item to an array without mutating the original array.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
const newArr = [...arr, 4]
console.log(newArr) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

It's also commonly used in objects, just like in React to merge the props of a component with the props passed in by the parent component.

```javascript /.../ {8}
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
}

const newPerson = {
  ...person,
  name: 'Jane',
  address: 'New York',
}

console.log(newPerson) // Output: { name: 'Jane', age: 30, address: 'New York' }
```

<Callout>
  Take note that the order of the spread operator matters. If you spread an object before another
  object, the properties of the first object will be overwritten by the second object.
</Callout>

Spread operator can also perform a shallow copy of the array or object. If you want to
do a deep copy, you'll need to use a library like
[lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#cloneDeep).

### Template Literals

Template literals, using backtick, are a way to concatenate strings and variables in JavaScript. They're commonly used in React to render dynamic content.

```javascript {4}
const name = 'John'
const age = 30

const message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`
console.log(message) // Output: 'Hello, my name is John and I'm 30 years old.'
```

### Nullish Coalescing Operator

Nullish coalescing is a way to check if a value is `null` or `undefined` and return a default value if it is. It's commonly used in React to set default props.

```javascript /??/ {3}
const name = null
const defaultName = 'John'

const person = {
  firstName: name ?? defaultName,
}

console.log(person.firstName) // Output: 'John'
```

### Logical OR Operator

The logical OR operator `||` is a way to check if a value is falsy and return a default value if it is. It's commonly used in React to set default props.

```javascript /||/ {3}
const name = ''
const defaultName = 'John'

const person = {
  firstName: name || defaultName,
}

console.log(person.firstName) // Output: 'John'
```

Nullish coalescing is different from the logical OR operator `||` because it only returns the
default value if the value is `null` or `undefined`. The logical OR operator returns the default
value if the value is falsy, which includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `''`, `false`, and `NaN`.

<Callout type="info">

  [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61481631/15544151).
</Callout>

## TypeScript

### Non-null Assertion Operator

The non-null assertion operator is a way to tell TypeScript that a value is not null or undefined. It uses the `!` operator to tell TypeScript that a value is not null or undefined.

```javascript /!/ {10}
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    state: 'NY',
  },
}

const zipCode = person.address.zipCode!
console.log(zipCode) // Output: undefined
```

<Callout>
  This is useful when you are **100% sure** that a value is not null or undefined, but TypeScript
  doesn't know it yet. Just be careful when using the non-null assertion operator because{' '}
  <ins>it can lead to runtime errors if the value is actually null or undefined</ins>.
</Callout>

### Types vs Interfaces

In TypeScript, both types and interfaces are used to define the shape of an object or a function. They can be used interchangeably in many cases, but there are some differences between them.

#### Interfaces

Interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. They can also be used to define the shape of a function. Interfaces are typically used to describe objects that have a specific set of properties.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string
  age: number
  address?: string
}

const john: Person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: '123 Main St.',
}
```

In the above example, we define an interface `Person` that has three properties: `name`, `age`, and `address`. The `address` property is optional. We then create an object `john` that matches the shape of the `Person` interface.

#### Types

Types are used to define a set of values that a variable can take. They're typically used to describe the types of variables, parameters, and return values in a function.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}

console.log(add(1, 2)) // Output: 3
console.log(add(1, 'asd')) // Error: Argument of type '"asd"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

...

type Person = {
  name: string
  age: number
  address?: string
}

const john: Person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: '123 Main St.',
}

const jane: Person = {
  name: 'Jane',
  age: '30', // Error: Type '"30"' is not assignable to type 'number'.
  address: '123 Main St.',
}
```

A real world example of using types is when you want to define the types of props in a React component.

```typescript
type Props = {
  name: string
  age: number
  address?: string
}

const Person = ({ name, age, address }: Props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      {address && <p>Address: {address}</p>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### When to Use Types vs Interfaces

In general, interfaces are used to describe the shape of an object and types are used to describe the types of variables and functions. However, in many cases, they can be used interchangeably.

Here are some guidelines to help you decide when to use a type vs an interface:

- Use an interface when you need to describe the structure of an object, including optional properties and methods.
- Use a type when you need to describe a set of values that a variable can take, or the types of parameters and return values in a function.
- If you need to extend an existing type or interface, use an interface.
- If you need to create an alias for an existing type or interface, use a type.
