# Contributing Guidelines

<Callout>
  Make sure you have have finished [joining the team](/getting-started/join) and [setting up the
  project](/getting-started/setup#project-setup).
</Callout>

This article shows the steps on how to contribute to the project. It is recommended to read the [project structure](/getting-started/setup#project-structure) first.

## Prerequisites

This section is a list of things you need to keep in mind when contributing to the project.

### How to commit better

The following video explains how to commit with better messages. It is recommended to watch the video before proceeding.

<IFrame src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hlp-9cdImSM?start=45" />

### Reminders

1. **Always** check which branch you are in.

2. **Always** include backlog item code at the start. For commit messages, you don't need to include the code **if** you just refactored/cleaned some code.

3. For commits, type the changes you've made in **detail** as much as possible (which was explained in the video above). Use newline to separate the title and the description.
   Example:

```md
ALT-10 Added a prototype for table data

The table data will be used for the dashboard page.
The table data will be fetched from the database.
```

4. If you have installed a new npm package, always inform the team and include it in the commit as well as in the PR description. Example:

```md
## What did you do?

- Added `Alert` shadcn component
- Added `nextjs-toploader` package
```

It is everyone's responsibility to run `npm install` in their local repository.

5. When switching branches, always `npx prisma generate` to generate the schema. This is to avoid errors when running the app.

6. If you're done with the task, **always** `git pull origin main`. This is to avoid conflicts when merging the PR.
   <Callout>
     **Why?** We want to pull the changes from everyone before pushing our code to the remote
     repository. Doing so will ensure that our local copy is in sync with new changes made by the
     team in the remote repository. Developers **MUST TEST** if everything is working by checking
     the web app (runtime errors/design fails) or the code (overwritten/missing files).
   </Callout>

## Trunk Based Development

Make sure you have been assigned a task in the [backlog](https://alt-ahead.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/ALT/boards/1/backlog). Ask the <TL name="team leader" /> for a task if you haven't been assigned one.
Follow steps **1-3** if you're starting a new task. If you're done with the task, follow steps **4-6**. If your PR has been reviewed and approved, follow steps **7-10**.

<Steps>

### Create a new branch from main.

For VS Code:

1. Make sure you're on the `main` branch by checking lower-left of status bar.
2. Go to Source Control (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)
3. Open actions menu (the 3 dots) then Branch > Create Branch...
4. Enter the code and title with spaces as hyphen (e.g `ALT-68-Sidebar-menu`).
5. Click "Publish Branch".

For Github Desktop:

1. Make sure you're on the `main` branch by checking "Current branch".
2. Go to Branch > New Branch or `Ctrl+Shift+N`
3. Enter the code and title with spaces as hyphen (e.g `ALT-68-Sidebar-menu`).
4. Select `main` branch then click "Create branch".
5. Click "Publish branch".

### Code üßë‚Äçüíª

### Commit and push.

1. Stage your files.

- For VSCode, press `+`
- For Github Desktop, open cmd, do `git status`, then `git add <file path>`

2. (Optional) Run `npx lint-staged` to check for linting errors.
3. Enter [commit message](#how-to-commit-better) (check [reminders](#reminders)) then commit.
4. Push/Sync.

### Pull from `main` branch.

Perform `git pull origin main` to get the latest changes from the `main` branch.

### Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to [repository's pull requests](https://github.com/ubergonmx/alt-tutors/pulls).
2. Click "New pull request".
3. Click `compare: main` then select your branch to PR (e.g `compare: ALT-68-Sidebar-menu`).
4. Click "Create pull request".
5. For the title, it must be in this format: `ALT-# Given task title` (e.g., `ALT 68 sidebar menu` to `ALT-68 Sidebar menu`). Take note of the casing and the hyphen.

6. For the description, follow the format below (you can copy-paste this):

```md {1} copy
# [ALT-#](link) <Copy the title here>

## What type of PR is this? (select all that apply)

- [x] üì¶ Feature
- üêõ Bug Fix
- üë®‚Äçüíª Code Refactor
- [x] üóíÔ∏è Documentation update

## Description

< enter the task description >

## What did you do?

(for example...)

- Learned how to use NextAuth
- Added the tech stack and the packages that will be used
- Updated `README.md`

## What to watch out for? (optional)

- Possible conflict between db schema of Draft 3 and NextAuth (for Google OAuth)
```

7. For the reviewers, add the team members who are familiar with the task.
8. Click "Create pull request".

### Notify the team for Code Review.

Chat at Discord and tag the team members who are assigned as the reviewers.
Let the reviewers review your code. If there are changes to be made, make the changes and commit again. If there are no changes to be made, the reviewers will approve the PR.

#### Checklist for reviewers

- [ ] Follows the [pull request format](#pull-request-pr).
- [ ] Follows the [coding standards](/getting-started/workflow/standards). If it doesn't, you can comment to the PR (or file) to link them to the coding standards page with the hyperlink. Example:

```md /#files-and-folders/
Not following [folder naming convention](https://alt-tutors-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/workflow/standards#files-and-folders) for `signUp` folder. Please rename to it `sign-up`.
```

- [ ] Working as intended. If there are errors/bugs, comment them with the screenshot and the possible solution.
- [ ] Documented properly.
- [ ] Tested properly.

Here's a short video how to review a PR:

<Video src="/videos/pr-review.mp4" />

### Merge the PR

After the PR has been approved, simply click the "Merge pull request" button.

import outOfDateBranch from '../../../public/images/out-of-date-branch.png'

<Screenshot src={outOfDateBranch} alt="Out of date branch" />

If the branch is out of date, go to VS Code terminal and type `git pull origin main` to update the branch. If there are conflicts, resolve them first before merging.

### Delete the branch

After merging the PR, delete the branch. This is to avoid clutter in the repo.

### Update and clean your local repo.

Switch to `main` branch then click the üîÑÔ∏è button; either VS Code (lower-left) or Github Desktop.
Since the deletion of the branch only happens in remote/cloud, we need to clean our local repo:

1. Open command prompt in our repo folder (or use terminal in VS Code)
2. Type `git fetch -p`.
3. Type `npm run clean-local`.

### Take a quick break. Don't forget to rest!

You deserve it! üéâ

</Steps>

## Common issues

### Lint-staged error

If you encounter the following error when commiting:

import failedToCommit from '../../../public/images/failed-to-commit.png'

<Screenshot src={failedToCommit} alt="Failed to commit" />

This is because an error has been found in your code. You can run `npx lint-staged` to see what checks failed. If there are no errors, you can commit again.

<Callout>
  When you encounter an error, try to search for the error message in Google. If you can't find the
  solution, ask the team for help. If you found the solution, please document it in the `#docs`
  channel in Discord.
</Callout>

### TypeScript errors

If for some unknown reasons all of your TS/TSX files are showing errors, try to restart TypeScript server or reload VS Code window by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` then type `restart ts server` or `reload window`.

### Accidental local commit

If you haven't synced your local repo and you accidentally committed, you can undo the commit by typing `git reset HEAD~1` in the terminal. This will undo the commit but not the changes you've made. You can now sync your local repo and commit again.

### Component not found

If you encounter an error like this:

```md
Module not found: Can't resolve '<package>' in '...'
```

This may mean that the package is listed in `package.json` but not installed in your local repo. You can install the package by typing `npm install` in the terminal. If it isn't listed in `package.json`, you can install it by typing `npm install <package>` in the terminal.

### Out-of-date branch

If you encounter an error like this:

```bash
fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
```

This means that your branch is out of date. You can update your branch by typing `git pull origin main` in the terminal. If there are conflicts, resolve them first before merging.
