# Coding Standards

<Callout type="warning">Docs for coding standards are under construction.</Callout>

Most of the coding standards are handled by Prettier and ESLint. However, there are some rules that are not covered by these tools. This document will cover those rules.

## General coding

1. **Space Conventions**:

   - Each nested block has to be spaced and indented appropriately.
   - A space is required after adding a comma separating two function parameters.

   Example: `method1(arg1, arg2)`, `app.use((req, res, err) =>..`

2. **Naming Conventions**:

   - **Functions** must be in **camelCase**.
   - **Variables**:

     - **Local & Parameter** variables must be in **camelCase**.
     - **Global** variables must be in **PascalCase**.
     - **Constant** variables must be in **UPPERCASE**.

   - **Files**:

     - **Schema** files must be in **PascalCase**.
     - **Controller** and `.hbs` files must be in **camelCase**.
     - **File paths** in `import` must be **case-sensitive**.
     - Front end files must be the same (e.g., `index.hbs`, `index.css`, `index.js`).

   - Names should be detailed enough that one immediately recognizes what the variable/function is used for. Use nouns & verbs of the business domain as identifiers for methods & variables.

3. **Error Messages**:

   Error messages must be clear and concise.

4. **Code Style**:

   Donâ€™t write in ALL CAPS (and avoid exclamation marks). Always document your code.

## TSX

1. When naming id and classes with more than one word, use **kebab-case** (hyphen).

   Example: `#about-me`, `.container-head`

2. Avoid shortening words as much as possible (e.g., 'details' to 'det') or using one-letter names (e.g., `#i`, or `.c`).

## CSS

1. **Grouping and Comments**:

   Add a comment to group structures/blocks.

   Example:

   ```css
   /* classes */
   .container {
       margin: 0;
   }
   ...
   ```

2. **Multiple Selectors**:

   If multiple selectors are used (`,`), enter on a newline for each selector.

   Example:

   ```css
   .username,
   .profile-pic {
     margin: 0;
   }
   ```
