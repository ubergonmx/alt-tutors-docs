# Standup Meeting

The setting and interval of the standup meeting depends on the current <TL>team leader</TL>, but the default is weekly, every **Monday** at **10:00 AM**.
If you are not able to attend the meeting, please let the <TL>team leader</TL> know in advance.

Here is the format of what you can share during the standup meeting:

1. What you did last week and what problems you encountered
2. What you did during the weekend (if any)
3. What you will do this week

Number 2 is optional and may be opt out by the <TL>team leader</TL>, but it's a good way to share what you did during the weekend with the team. This is to encourage the team to get to know each other better.
